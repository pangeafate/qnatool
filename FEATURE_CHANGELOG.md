# QnA Builder - Feature Changelog
*All changes since (and including) Additional Information Popup*

## 🎉 **Deployment**
- ✅ **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Application successfully deployed at GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Automated Build Pipeline**: Configured with `npm run deploy` command
- ✅ **Production Ready**: TypeScript compilation and build optimization enabled

## 🔧 **Core Functionality Fixes**

### **Copy-Paste System Overhaul**
- ✅ **Fixed Selection State Synchronization**: Resolved circular dependency between Zustand store and React Flow state
- ✅ **Event Handling Improvements**: Added proper `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling
- ✅ **Immediate Copy Logic**: Copy operations now happen before state updates to prevent selection clearing
- ✅ **Array Mutation Fixes**: Used spread operator to create copies before sorting read-only arrays
- ✅ **React Flow API Integration**: Proper use of `reactFlowInstance.setNodes()` for selection management

### **Selection System Enhancements**
- ✅ **Shift+Click Selection**: Fixed issues with shift+click multi-selection
- ✅ **Selection Box Dragging**: Improved drag selection behavior with proper state management
- ✅ **Feedback Loop Prevention**: Eliminated selection clearing when releasing Shift key
- ✅ **State Consistency**: Synchronized selection between React Flow and custom store

## ✨ **Visual Feedback Features**

### **Node Pulse Animations**
- ✅ **Selection Animation**: Added infinite blue pulse animation for selected nodes
- ✅ **Copy Confirmation Pulse**: Green pulse animation for copied nodes (originally 2 seconds, optimized to 1 second)
- ✅ **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Bypassed React Flow styling limitations using `querySelector`
- ✅ **Animation Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup with `animationend` event listeners
- ✅ **Color Matching**: Purple/blue colors matching click selection style

### **Advanced Selection Modes**
- ✅ **Dual Selection Modes**: 
  - **Shift+Drag**: Copy mode - select nodes, auto-copy to clipboard, show green pulse
  - **Shift+D+Drag**: Delete mode - select nodes and immediately delete them
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Different cursor styles and behavior for each mode
- ✅ **Mode Detection**: Independent tracking of Shift and D keys
- ✅ **Hotkey Integration**: Removed old Shift+D hotkey in favor of selection mode

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Paste Functionality**
- ✅ **Viewport Centering**: Paste now centers nodes in current viewport instead of fixed offset
- ✅ **Smart Positioning**: Calculates viewport center using bounds and zoom level
- ✅ **Bounding Box Calculation**: Groups nodes and centers them at target position
- ✅ **No Auto-Selection**: Pasted nodes don't auto-select to keep focus on originals

### **Debug Panel Removal**
- ✅ **Cleaner Interface**: Removed debug panel showing "Selected IDs", "Clipboard", and "Shift" status
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Eliminated development-only UI elements

## 🗺️ **Minimap Enhancements**

### **Sibling Node Highlighting**
- ✅ **Relationship Detection**: Smart detection of upstream (parent) and downstream (child) siblings
- ✅ **Color Coding System**:
  - **Selected nodes**: Dark high-contrast colors with blue borders
  - **Upstream siblings**: Orange theme colors (nodes that connect TO selected)
  - **Downstream siblings**: Purple theme colors (nodes that selected connects TO)
  - **Unrelated nodes**: Muted gray colors that fade into background
- ✅ **Enhanced Borders**: 2px solid borders on all minimap nodes for better visibility
- ✅ **Hover Feedback**: Darker borders on hover without movement/offset
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between node types and relationships

## 🎛️ **Smart Organization Algorithm**

### **Layout Algorithm Overhaul**
- ✅ **Connected Components Detection**: Groups related nodes together automatically
- ✅ **Hierarchical Layering**: Respects parent-child relationships with proper BFS level assignment
- ✅ **Edge Crossing Minimization**: Sorts nodes by connection count and applies micro-adjustments
- ✅ **Component Isolation**: Separates disconnected subgraphs with proper spacing
- ✅ **Smart Clustering**: Positions highly connected nodes centrally within their level

### **Enhanced Spacing System** *(Latest Update)*
- ✅ **Doubled Spacing**: All spacing parameters increased 2x for maximum visual clarity:
  - **Horizontal spacing**: 500px → 1000px
  - **Layer spacing**: 350px → 700px  
  - **Component separation**: 300px → 600px
  - **Sibling adjustments**: 120px → 240px
- ✅ **Consistent Application**: Applied to both manual organize and auto-organize functions
- ✅ **Dynamic Width Calculation**: Component width now adapts to larger spacing requirements

## 📋 **Technical Architecture**

### **State Management**
- ✅ **Zustand Integration**: Proper state synchronization between store and React Flow
- ✅ **Bulk Update Handling**: Special handling for organize operations to prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Event Prevention**: Comprehensive event handling to prevent UI conflicts

### **Animation System**
- ✅ **CSS Keyframes**: Professional animation definitions with proper timing
- ✅ **Dynamic Class Application**: Runtime CSS class management for visual effects
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of animations and event listeners

### **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ **useMemo Hooks**: Efficient computation of sibling relationships
- ✅ **useCallback Dependencies**: Proper dependency arrays for event handlers
- ✅ **Debounced Updates**: Prevented excessive re-renders during selection operations

## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **Code Quality**
- ✅ **TypeScript Compliance**: Fixed all TypeScript errors for production build
- ✅ **Unused Variable Cleanup**: Removed unused variables for cleaner code
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- ✅ **Debugging Support**: Extensive console logging for troubleshooting

### **Build System**
